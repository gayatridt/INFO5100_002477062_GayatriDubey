Create two objects - Alice and Bob
Demonstrate symmetric encryption and decryption of message sent between Alice and Bob
Use AES-256 encryption with AES/GCM/NoPadding cipher
E.g.: Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding");
Demonstrate asymmetric encryption and decryption of message sent between Alice and Bob
Use RSA-2048 encryption RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding
Demonstrate signing a message and validating the signature using RSA-2048 keys between Alice and Bob
